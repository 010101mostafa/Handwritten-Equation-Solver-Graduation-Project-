# Handwritten Equation Solver

Solving mathematical expressions is not restricted to just students but also for
mathematicians, physicists, and scientists. The idea of solving math equations is
quite intriguing.

And it has become necessary to find an easy way to solve these equations and
mathematical expressions. The traditional method of solving math expressions is
unsatisfactory for two main reasons.

First, it requires users to learn different rules and approaches for each
the mathematical equation they face.

Second, the steps of solving mathematical expressions may take a lot of time or
be complex or obscure and could cause the user to make mistakes while solving
an expression.

Hence we proposed a project that will allow user to just capture image
containing the Mathematical expression and solve it without making the user
dive into the complex rules.
